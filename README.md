# Favorite Hobbies Webpage
This is a simple html project that highlights two of my favorite hobbies. 
## Purpose of the project
This project was created to show my understanding of html structure and semantic tags. 
### `<header>`
The header contains the main title of the website, this helps users know the purpose of the site.
### `<nav>`
The navigation bar allows users to move between different parts of the page, this can improve usability.
### `<section id="dance">`
This section mentions the type of styles of dance I like and mentions that I take regular classes. It also includes an image of dancers in class.
### `<section id="reading">`
This section mentions the type of genres I love to read and an image of piles of books.
### `<footer>`
The footer includes my name.
## Media Integration
This site includes two images, added using the <img> tag.
## Theme choice
I chose this theme because it includes two things I enjoy doing and represents a big part of who I am.
## Technologies used
HTML5
