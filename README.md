# Favorite Hobbies Webpage
This is a simple html project that highlights two of my favorite hobbies. 
## Purpose of the project
This project was created to show my understanding of html structure and semantic tags. 
### `<header>`
The header contains the main title of the website, this helps users know the purpose of the site.
### `<nav>`
The navigation bar allows users to move between different parts of the page, this can improve usability.
### `<section id="dance">`
This section mentions the type of styles of dance I like and mentions that I take regular classes. It also includes an image of dancers in class.
### `<section id="reading">`
This section mentions the type of genres I love to read and an image of piles of books.
### `<footer>`
The footer includes my name.
## Media Integration
This site includes two images, added using the <img> tag.
## Theme choice
I chose this theme because it includes two things I enjoy doing and represents a big part of who I am.
# Advanced CSS & Responsive Design
This part of my project enhances my original layout with the following:
- Mobile-first styling
- Media queries
- Flexbox layout
- Customized navigation list
- CSS transitions for interactivity
## Layout Strategy
- I used **Flexbox** throughtout the site to adjust spacing and align content.
- I used a mobile-first approach and used media queries to adjust layout.
## Customized Navigation List
- I styled my existing navigation list with 'background-color', 'padding', and 'border-radius'.
- I used 'display: flex' to arrange the links horizontally on larger screens.
- I used 'gap' and 'justify-content' for clean spacing.
## Transitions & Interactivity
- I added an animation effect on hover for each navigation link. The links turn into buttons and change background and text color which adds interactivity.
## CSS Validation
- I used W3C CSS validator to validate my stylesheet and my file passed with no errors or warnings.
## Challenges
- I struggled with some CSS values overriding each other but used DevTools to help me troubleshoot.
- I also began this assignment by editing a copy of my stylesheet but not actually working out of the copied folder in VS code and it took me a while to figure out what was happening and why my updated CSS was not showing up on my site preview. I did eventually figure this out and re-organized my folders.
